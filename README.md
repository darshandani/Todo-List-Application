Task: Build a Todo List Application

Description: Your task is to develop a simple Todo List application using Laravel, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. The application should allow users to create, view, edit, and delete todo items. Users should also be able to mark todo items as completed.

Requirements:
User Authentication: Implement a basic user authentication system with registration and login functionality. Passwords should be securely hashed before storing in the database.

Todo List: Users should be able to view a list of todo items on the homepage. Each todo item should have a title, description, due date, status (completed or pending), and the option to mark it as completed.

CRUD Operations: Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for todo items. Users should be able to add new todo items, edit existing ones, and delete items they no longer need.

Database: Use MySQL or any other relational database to store user information and todo items. Design the necessary tables with appropriate relationships.
User Interface: Design a simple and intuitive user interface using HTML and CSS for the frontend. Ensure that the application is responsive and accessible on different devices.

Validation: Implement form validation on the todo item creation and update forms to ensure that users enter valid information. Also, validate input data before inserting/updating into the database to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and display meaningful error messages to users.
Sorting and Filtering: Allow users to sort todo items based on due date or status. Implement filtering options to show only pending or completed items.
Deliverables:

Complete source code of the Todo List application.
SQL script to create the necessary database tables.
